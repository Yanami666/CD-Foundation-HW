      <h2>1 · Emptiness</h2>
      <p>
        There was no one inside him, nothing but a trace of chill, a dream
        dreamt by no one else behind the face that looks like no other face
        (even in the bad paintings of the period) and the abundant, whimsical,
        impassioned words.

      <h2>2 · Assumptions &amp; Initiation</h2>
      <p>
        He started out assuming that everyone was just like him; the puzzlement
        of a friend to whom he had confided a little of his emptiness revealed
        his error and left him with the lasting impression that the individual
        should not diverge from the species. At one time he thought he could
        find a cure for his ailment in books and accordingly learned the
        "small Latin and less Greek" to which a contemporary later referred.
        He next decided that what he was looking for might be found in the
        practice of one of humanity's more elemental rituals: he allowed Anne
        Hathaway to initiate him over the course of a long June afternoon.

      <h2>3 · London &amp; Stage</h2>
      <p>
        In his twenties he went to London. He had become instinctively adept
        at pretending to be somebody, so that no one would suspect he was in
        fact nobody. In London he discovered the profession for which he was
        destined, that of the actor who stands on a stage and pretends to be
        someone else in front of a group of people who pretend to take him for
        that other person.

      <h2>4 · Proteus &amp; Many</h2>
      <p>
        Theatrical work brought him rare happiness, possibly the first he had
        ever known&mdash;but when the last line had been applauded and the last
        corpse removed from the stage, the odious shadow of unreality fell over
        him again: he ceased being Ferrex or Tamburlaine and went back to being
        nobody. Hard pressed, he took to making up other heroes, other tragic
        tales. While his body fulfilled its bodily destiny in the taverns and
        brothels of London, the soul inside it belonged to Caesar who paid no
        heed to the oracle's warnings and Juliet who hated skylarks and Macbeth
        in conversation, on the heath, with witches who were also the Fates.
        No one was as many men as this man: like the Egyptian Proteus, he used
        up the forms of all creatures.

      <h2>5 · Confessions &amp; Iago</h2>
      <p>
        Every now and then he would tuck a confession into some hidden corner
        of his work, certain that no one would spot it. Richard states that he
        plays many roles in one, and Iago makes the odd claim: "I am not what I
        am." The fundamental identity of existing, dreaming, and acting inspired
        him to write famous lines.

      <h2>6 · Tedium &amp; Sale</h2>
      <p>
        For twenty years he kept up this controlled delirium. Then one morning
        he was overcome by the tedium and horror of being all those kings who
        died by the sword and all those thwarted lovers who came together and
        broke apart and melodiously suffered. That very day he decided to sell
        his troupe.

      <h2>7 · Return &amp; Will</h2>
      <p>
        Before the week was out he had returned to his hometown: there he
        reclaimed the trees and the river of his youth without tying them to
        the other selves that his muse had sung, decked out in mythological
        allusion and latinate words. He had to be somebody, and so he became a
        retired impresario who dabbled in money-lending, lawsuits, and petty
        usury. It was as this character that he wrote the rather dry last will
        and testament with which we are familiar, having purposefully expunged
        from it every trace of emotion and every literary flourish. When friends
        visited him from London, he went back to playing the role of poet for
        their benefit.

      <h2>8 · One Man, Myself</h2>
      <p>
        The story goes that shortly before or after his death, when he found
        himself in the presence of God, he said: "I who have been so many men
        in vain want to be one man only, myself."

      <h2>9 · Voice of God</h2>
      <p>
        The voice of God answered him out of a whirlwind: "Neither am I what I
        am. I dreamed the world the way you dreamt your plays, dear Shakespeare.
        You are one of the shapes of my dreams: like me, you are everything and
        nothing."
